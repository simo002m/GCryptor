# GCryptor
GCryptor is an easy-to-use graphical tool for encrypting and decrypting a file. GCryptor is written in Python 3.

If you're using this on Windows or MacOS then change "/usr/share/icons/gcryptor_icon.gif"
to be "gcryptor_icon.gif" instead(in gcryptor.py).

To install/configure it for Linux so that it appears as a command and even an application with
an icon in the menu then type:

sudo bash Linux/install.sh

And to uninstall it:

sudo bash Linux/uninstall.sh

If you run it without the sudo, it's probably not going to be configured properly. 


Note:
if you're using this application on an Arch or Arch-based distribution, you most likely
have to install tk for this to work, this can be done by typing:

sudo pacman -S tk
